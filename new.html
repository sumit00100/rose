                <span>Dear Buddy,</span>
                <br />
                On this Rose Day, I want to take a moment to remind you how 
                incredibly proud I am of you, my dear sister. Just like a 
                rose, you are strong, resilient, and beautiful in every way. 
                Your hard work and dedication inspire me every single day. As 
                your board exams approach, remember that you are capable of 
                achieving greatness. Believe in yourself, stay focused, and 
                keep pushing forwardâ€”youâ€™ve got this! Iâ€™ll always be here to 
                support and cheer you on. Keep shining, my star! Happy Rose 
                Day, sis! ðŸŒ¹ðŸ’ªâœ¨
                <br />
                <span class="ullu">
                    Always Yours,
                    <br />
                    Good Buddy</span>
